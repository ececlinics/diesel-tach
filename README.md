# ECE Clinics: Diesel Tachometer
This is the main directory for the diesel tachometer project. The objective of this project is to design an adapter and mount for a diesel engine tachometer sensor. More specifically, the team is designing a better filter for the tachometer circuit. This repository will feature any and all code development for the project.

# Intro
Most comercial vehicles on the road today have tachometers, but some diesel engine vehicles, such as older trucks or farm vehicles, do not. Many companies sell aftermarket diesel tachometers, which are the center focus of this project. Typical tachometers in gas engines may tap off the electrical signals from the spark plugs. However, since diesel engines instead use glow plugs which do not provide much useful data, diesel tachometers sense and measure using different methods. One method involves using magnetic pickup on the coil of the alternator.
