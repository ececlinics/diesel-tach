# Development Software
Code was generated, debugged, and programmed using **ST Visual Develop (STVD) and ST Visual Programmer (STVP)** ([Link to product page](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stvd-stm8.html)). The **COSMIC Toolchain** was the toolchain of choice for compilation because it was free and compiled in C ([Link to product page](http://www.cosmic-software.com/download.php)).
