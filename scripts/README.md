# Scripts
This is the directory for scripts written for the project. So far, it contains only MATLAB m-files.

## MATLAB Version
These m-files were generated in **MATLAB R2018a**.

### import4mat.m
*Import* CSV data contained in named folders and for-*(4)*-*mat* into cells.

#### Dependencies
This function assumes we have four folders in the present directory named:
* 04_Ford_F250
* 12_Jeep_Wrangler
* 98_Dodge_Ram
* 98_GMC_2500

Files in these folders must contain CSV files, otherwise the program will only throw warnings.
